# 🐿️ Sniffer.AI - IoT Devices
# AI-powered Network Traffic Analysis for IoT Device Identification & Security


# 🚀 Overview
**Sniffer.AI** is an advanced AI tool designed to analyze network packet captures (PCAPs), .csv log files and identify IoT devices by their network behavior. It leverages machine learning to provide real-time insights into your network, helping you enhance visibility, automate asset discovery, and strengthen security postures.

# 🧠 Key Capabilities
**✅ IoT Device Identification**
- Upload PCAP files and detect connected IoT devices.
- Uses ML models trained on behavioral traffic patterns.
- Works with a wide range of consumer and industrial IoT devices.

# 🔐 Security Monitoring
Flag unusual traffic behavior that may signal compromise or misconfiguration.
Useful for incident response, forensic analysis, and continuous monitoring.

# 📊 Automated Classification
Instantly classify devices (e.g., smart cameras, thermostats, speakers).
Supports dynamic environments with frequent device churn.

# 🧪 PCAP Analysis with Zero Setup
Run directly in the browser via Hugging Face Spaces.
No local dependencies or complex installs required.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
Powered by Python, Scikit-learn, and Gradio for rapid prototyping.
Integrated with Hugging Face Spaces for live, shareable demos.

# 🔍 Use Cases
**Use Case	Benefits**
Enterprise Network Audits	Discover all IoT endpoints in your environment.
Home Lab Security	Identify unknown devices and monitor traffic.
Red Team Recon	Profile IoT environments during assessments.
IoT Device Profiling	Generate behavioral signatures for new devices.

# 📂 How to Use
Go to the Live Demo [https://huggingface.co/spaces/SilverDragon9/Sniffer.AI-IoT-Devices].
Upload a .pcap file or one of the sample.csv files.
Click Analyze.
View identified IoT devices and insights.

# 💡 Tip: Use tools like tcpdump or Wireshark to collect .pcap data from your network.

# 👩‍💻 Developer Notes
